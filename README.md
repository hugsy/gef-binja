```

#### GEF Installation

If you don't have [`gef`](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) on the host where your GDB is running, the quickest way to install it is by running the following command from a shell prompt:


```bash
wget -q -O- https://github.com/hugsy/gef/raw/master/scripts/gef.sh | sh
```

In GDB, configure `gef` to connect to Binary Ninja:

```
gefâž¤  gef config ida-interact
```

*Note*: the config option is called `ida-interact` because GEF uses the same protocol for both communication with Binja and IDA.
